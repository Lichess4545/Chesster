# CHESSTER [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/endrawes0/Chesster.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/endrawes0/Chesster)
## Introduction
This bot was created to help moderate the Lichess45+45 league.

It has a simple interface that integrates our slack team with Lichess and Google Spreadsheets.

I hope to make future improvements as time goes on.

If you have any issues, reach out to me here on github.

Cheers.
Andrew W. Haddad
